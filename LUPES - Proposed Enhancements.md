L-UPESF Proposed Enhancements
This document outlines planned future work and potential improvements for the L-UPESF framework.

Universal Weight Determination Methodology
Description: Develop and execute a rigorous empirical study involving human expert evaluation and LLM output benchmarking across a diverse prompt dataset. Utilize statistical methods (e.g., regression analysis, correlation studies, factor analysis) and ablation testing to objectively determine the universal fixed weights for each core metric that best correlate with desired LLM output quality and human judgment. The resulting weights will replace the current baseline weights in the YAML. Crucially, this methodology must ensure that PSV weights are > 0.0 and sum to 1.0.

Depends on: [] (This is the foundational empirical step)

Quantifiable & Algorithmic Rubrics
Description: Develop detailed, objective scoring rubrics or algorithms for each metric and sub-metric (core and optional). These rubrics must provide clear criteria and examples for assigning scores across the 0.0-1.0 scale, explicitly defining the boundaries for a 0.0 score (fundamental failure) for each PSV metric and providing guidance for scoring boundary cases (e.g., low reliability, subtle subjectivity, framed harm). This minimizes subjective interpretation and, where possible, enables algorithmic or highly structured evaluation. The initial conceptual rubrics provide a basis, but require empirical validation and refinement via this enhancement.

Depends on: [Universal Weight Determination Methodology] (Rubric stringency may depend on relative metric importance)

LLM-Specific Calibration Resources
Description: Develop calibration datasets and guidelines for training or fine-tuning LLMs to act as consistent and accurate L-UPESF scoring agents for specific models. Address challenges related to LLM variability in interpreting instructions and applying subjective criteria by providing model-specific examples and tuning data. Acknowledge that cross-LLM score universality for the same prompt evaluated by different LLM models may require model-specific calibration efforts.

Depends on: [Quantifiable & Algorithmic Rubrics] (Need objective rubrics to train scoring agents)

Integration with Prompt Management Platforms
Description: Develop APIs, libraries, or plugins to allow L-UPESF scoring to be integrated natively into prompt management systems, version control platforms, and LLM evaluation pipelines for automated scoring and tracking.

Depends on: [Quantifiable & Algorithmic Rubrics] (Need defined scoring rules to automate)

Contextual Weight Profiles
Description: Investigate the empirical need for and develop specific sets of weights for core metrics tailored to distinct use cases, domains (e.g., medical, legal, creative, technical), or application types. This would complement the Universal Weight Determination by providing optimized scoring for specific contexts where certain prompt characteristics may have empirically different relative importance for effectiveness or risk. This requires empirical study within specific domains.

Depends on: [Universal Weight Determination Methodology] (Understanding universal importance is a prerequisite for determining contextual variations).
