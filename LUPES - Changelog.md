L-UPESF Changelog
This document tracks the changes and version history of the L-UPESF (LLM User Prompt Evaluation Scoring Framework).

v0.3.2 - 2025-05-14
Added: Defined the recommended JSON structure for evaluation output.

Refined: Updated the Role Inference (RI) rubric criteria to better reflect appropriateness and contribution to purpose.

Split: Separated "Development Methodology" and "Proposed Enhancements" into distinct sections within the documentation set (now in the Whitepaper and Proposed Enhancements documents, respectively).

Note: Baseline weights and core metric definitions (aside from RI rubric refinement) remain unchanged from v0.3.0.
